# Final Capstone Project - Project Report
## Descriptive title: New York's Borough Investigation
## Preface
_Now, after acquiring the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, this is a final project to illustrate an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities, or to come up with a problem that can use the Foursquare location data to solve._

## 1. Introduction/Business Problem
Although we have the information of neighbourhoods in Manhattan, for **the urban planners and government who are my audience**, they may want to know more about how other boroughs are like and how the KMeans-clustered neighbourhoods are actually close to each other, which will relate to their ability to coorporate with each other for boosting tourisms and the ease of future planning.

Here, we will continue the work of clustering and segmentation of New York mentioned in our course, but we will investigate the other boroughs as well. Once we obtain thier geographical data, we will conduct K-Means clustering neighbourhoods-wise and DBSCAN, which is a common spatial clustering method, on each resulting cluster. For only prove-of-concept, we will choose **The Bronx** as our another target borough since it has similar estimated population with **Manhattan** (Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City)).
Hence, we have two questions here:
1. Illustrate how the clusters of Manhattan and The Bronx are different/similar after K-Mean clustering.
2. Using spatial clustering, find out whether the neighbourhoods belonged to the same clusters above are really close to each other.

## 2. Data and Materials
Here, we will use two different sets of data: one is New York neighborhood data with 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods, published by [NYU Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572); the another one is FourSquare data for exploring the neighbourhoods of the two targeted boroughs (Foursquare API will be used, details will be presented in _Methodology_).
