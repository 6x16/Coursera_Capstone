# Coursera Capstone Project for Applied Data Science
### Repository name: Coursera_Capstone
It's for Coursera capstone project. Here you will find my own steps to show how I finish my project. In this project, I will not only use different common data science Python packages **(e.g. NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)** to handle my dataset, but also show you step-by-step how to tidy up your raw datasets from different sources into one neatly-arranged dataframe.

All source codes written here are in Jupyter notebook.

Here are the Python3 packages you may want to know more:
#### Data-handling packages:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
#### Machine-learning packages:
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn
#### Visualization packages:
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- folium
#### Web-scraping packages:
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- json
